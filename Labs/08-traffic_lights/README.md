# Lab 8: Traffic light controller

#### Objectives

In this laboratory exercise you will implement a finite state machine, specifically a traffic light controller at a junction. You will use the Xilinx Isim simulator or the EDA playground online tool. You will use a push button on the CoolRunner board as reset device, onboard clock signal with frequency of 10&nbsp;kHz for synchronization, and CPLD expansion board LEDs as outputs.
