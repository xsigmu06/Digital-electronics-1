#### Objectives

In this laboratory exercise you will implement BCD counters. You will use the Xilinx Isim simulator or the EDA playground online tool. You will use a push button on the CoolRunner board as reset device, onboard clock signal with frequency of 10&nbsp;kHz for synchronization, and 7-segment display as output device
